## Optional Paid Add-ons

Some advanced VyHub features like the [forum](../guide/forum.md) are paid.

The add-ons can be purchased on the [central instance dashboard](https://vyhub.net/dashboard). 
There you find all available add-ons and the current prices.

### Cancelling Add-ons

Every add-on can be cancelled by you at the end of every billing cycle.   
Cancelling is as well done through the central instance
dashboard [https://vyhub.net/dashboard](https://vyhub.net/dashboard).

## Payment of your Instance

During the month, the revenue of your instance is collected and reflected in
your [VyHub Balance](https://vyhub.net/account).  
At the end of the month, all costs of the month come into effect and will be debited from your VyHub Balance.
You then have __7 days__ to settle up your negative balance, either manually or automatically (Auto-Charge). The payment deadline is extended to __22 days__ when Auto-Charge is enabled.

### Recommended: Auto-Charge

We recommend to set up Auto-Charge for your account. 
With Auto-Charge, you will never forget to top up your balance in time.

At the beginning of each month you will receive an email about your outstanding balance. 
The balance will then be collected through your selected payment method within the next 14 days.

**Supported Payment Methods**

- PayPal
- Stripe

> The minium amount for a single charge is 5.00 €. Your positive balance will be used to settle costs of the following months.

#### Example Charge Cycle

### Outstanding Balance
