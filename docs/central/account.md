# VyHub Balance and Pricing

This article is about the pricing of VyHub instances and how payments are settled.

## Pricing of VyHub

Every VyHub instance is free to use, but a small 3-7% commission is charged on your revenue. So you only pay for VyHub,
when you make money.   

<sub>Local currencies are converted to EUR on a daily basis.</sub>

## Optional Paid Add-Ons

Certain VyHub features like the [forum](../guide/forum.md) are paid.   

The add-ons can be purchased in the central instance dashboard [https://vyhub.net/dashboard](https://vyhub.net/dashboard). There you find all available add-ons and the current prices. 

### Cancel Add-Ons
Every add-on can be cancelled by you at the end of every billing cycle.   
Cancelling is as well done through the central instance dashboard [https://vyhub.net/dashboard](https://vyhub.net/dashboard).

## Payment of your Instance

During the month, the revenue of your instance is collected and reflected on
your [VyHub balance](https://vyhub.net/account).  
At the end of the month, a invoice will be created which is either paid by your current balance (if positive) or charged
automatically through PayPal or Stripe.

### Recommended: Auto Charge

We recommend you setting up auto charge. With auto charge you will never forget to top up your balance.

At the beginning of each month you will receive an email about your outstanding balance. The balance will then be
collected through your payment method.

**Supported Payment Methods**

- PayPal
- Stripe

> The minium auto charge is 5€. Your positive balance will be used to settle the balance of the following months.

#### Example Charge Cycle

| Month   | Monthly Bill | Balance before charge | Charge Up | Balance after charge |

| Month 1 | -3€          | 0€                    | 5€        | 2€                   |
| Month 2 | -1€          | 2€                    | 0€        | 1€                   |
| Month 3 | -8€          | 1€                    | 7€        | 0€                   |

otherwise the instance will be stopped.

### Outstanding Balance
