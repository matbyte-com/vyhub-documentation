# Serverbundle

Servers are organised within serverbundles.

## Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Name of serverbundle |
| Multiple Groups | If enabled, a user can be member in multiple groups simultaneously |
| Color | Color of serverbundle |
| Icon | Icon displayed to identify serverbundle throughout VyHub |
| Type | Type of the serverbundle (applies to servers within the bundle) |
| Default Group | Default group every user has by default in the serverbundle. | 

**Servers** within the same **serverbundle** are from the same **type** (e.g. GMOD). 

**Serverbundles** are an abstraction from **servers**.  
Other features of **VyHub** like [Bans](ban.md)/[Warnings](warning.md) and the [Shop](shop/general.md "Shop") are using **serverbundles**.

## Create a Serverbundle

Navigate to the `Server` settings.  
Press the `Add Serverbundle` button and follow the steps in the dialog.
