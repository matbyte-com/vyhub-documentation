# Serverbundle

> Servers are organised within Serverbundles

**Servers** within the same **serverbundle** are from the same **type** (e.g. GMod). 

**Serverbundles** are an abstraction from **servers**.  
Other features of **VyHub** like [Bans / Warnings](bans.md "Bans and Warnings") and [Shop](shop.md "Shop") are using **serverbundles**

## Create a Serverbundle

Navigate to the **Server** settings.  
Press the **Add Serverbundle** button and follow the steps in the dialog.
