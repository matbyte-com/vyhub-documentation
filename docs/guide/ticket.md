## Ban Protests

In the ban details page players can directly protest the ban. A new ticket with a link to the ban is created.   
Admins and moderators can then communicate with the player and make a decision. 

Alternatively a external `Ban Protest URL` can be set in the **[ban settings](ban.md)**. E.g. this URL can be used to
redirect players to your forum.
